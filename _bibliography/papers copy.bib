  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Synergizing Data Imputation and Electronic Health Records for Advancing Prostate Cancer Research: Challenges, and Practical Applications},
  abstract={The presence of detailed clinical information in electronic health record (EHR) systems presents promising prospects for enhancing patient care through automated retrieval techniques. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged that accessing data within EHRs is hindered by various methodological challenges. Specifically, the clinical notes stored in EHRs are composed in a narrative form, making them prone to ambiguous formulations and highly unstructured data presentations, while structured reports commonly suffer from missing and/or erroneous data entries. This inherent complexity poses significant challenges when attempting automated large-scale medical knowledge extraction tasks, necessitating the application of advanced tools, such as natural language processing (NLP), as well as data audit techniques. This work aims to address these obstacles by creating and validating a novel pipeline designed to extract relevant data pertaining to prostate cancer patients. The objective is to exploit the inherent redundancies available within the integrated structured and unstructured data entries within EHRs in order to generate comprehensive and reliable medical databases, ready to be used in advanced research studies. Additionally, the study explores potential opportunities arising from these data, offering valuable prospects for advancing research in prostate cancer.},
