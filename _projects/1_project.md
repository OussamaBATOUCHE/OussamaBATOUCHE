My teeth is a computer software, the first one that I've entirely designed and developed by myself. The idea came to my mind while visiting a dentist clinic in Algiers. At that time, I was still a bachelor's student and had just learned how to use <a href='https://windev.com/'>Windev</a>.

Initially, I revisited the clinic and inquired whether they would be interested in purchasing software designed to manage their patients' documents, visits, and appointments. The answer was YES.

I dedicated two months of my summer vacation to working on this project and delivered the first version to the client. Subsequently, I visited various clinics, presenting my product, and successfully sold a couple of copies.

This marked my initial entry into the software development market.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

UML was employed during the conceptual design of this solution. Subsequently, the entire system and backend were developed following Object-Oriented programming principles.
