LE PROSPECT ("THE PROSPECT" in English) is a web-based application specialsed in the prospection management. I have developed this system together with my collegue (Bensaib Kamel) within 6 months, in the context of our Bachelor's final project. This solution has been later used by <a href='https://fecomit.com/'>FecomIT</a> in their prospection workflow.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/p7/fecomit.png" title="fecomeit_batouche" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

In this project, we have developped a system to manage the company's prospective clients, where they can fellow the client's trajectory (prospect to client). Our solution enabled couple of features among them we can state:

<ul>
    <li> New prospect: </li>
    <li> Scorring: </li>
    <li> Contact prospect: </li>
    <li> Task manager: </li>
    <li> Emailing: </li>
    <li> Live chat: </li>
    <li> Custumised features: </li>
</ul>

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/p7/prospects.png" title="le_prospect_batouche" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/p7/taches1.png" title="le_prospect_batouche" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    </div>
</div>

    These are couple of scheenshots from the web application "LE PROSPECT", the one one the left shows the list of prspective clients with different details, the one in the middle shows the tasks assign to the commercial team including the progress, and the one on the right shows part of the form used to created a new prospect client.

UML was employed during the conceptual design of this solution. Subsequently, the entire system and backend were developed following Object-Oriented programming principles.
