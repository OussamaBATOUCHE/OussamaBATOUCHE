<h2 style="color: orange" >Title: Object detection based on real-time video streaming</h2>
<h3>Abstract </h3>
<p>The integration of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) has been an active research topic in recent years, particularly as high-speed internet emerged, and 5G proved itself, machines connected are required to implement difficult tasks that cannot be easily performed under human control.

This thesis proposes an approach that uses an on-board camera, a Global Positioning System (GPS) module and a machine learning-based model to detect and track objects.

This approach is more cost-effective and more adaptable to the autonomous vehicle environment. Our framework improved execution time, including latency, by dividing tasks into parallel processes, which reduces processing time, and we established object detection using YOLO V4, with the ability to perform calculations on the connected device to save time and share tasks.

The test results showed that the object tracking framework we designed overcame an obstacle along the way, and its realization gave very interesting performance which can offer the possibility of exploring new applications in different domains. such as tourism or the fight against crime.</p>
